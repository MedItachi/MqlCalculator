#Calculator Project


This is a basic calculator project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#Usage
To use the calculator, simply enter the numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons. The calculator will display the result of your calculations in real-time as you enter your input.

#How It Works
The calculator reads user input in the form of a string, parses the input to extract the numbers and operators, and performs the necessary calculations. The order of operations is followed, with high-priority operations such as multiplication and division being performed before low-priority operations such as addition and subtraction
